We recommend reading the [ENS documentation](https://docs.ens.domains/) to get deeper insights about the internals of the name service.\n *\n * ## Breaking Changes\n *\n * -   All the API level interfaces returning or accepting `null` in 1.x, use `undefined` in 4.x.\n * -   Functions don't accept a callback anymore.\n * -   Functions that accepted an optional `TransactionConfig` as the last argument, now accept an optional `NonPayableCallOptions`. See `web3-eth-contract` package for more details.\n * -   Removed all non-read methods. If you need modifing resolver or registry, please use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ensdomains/ensjs\n */\n/**\n * This comment _supports3_ [Markdown](https://marked.js.org/)\n */\nimport { registryAddresses } from './config.js';\nexport * from './ens.js';\nexport { registryAddresses };","map":{"version":3,"names":["registryAddresses"],"sources":["../../src/index.ts"],"sourcesContent":[null],"mappings":"AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAiBA;;;;;;;;;;AAUA;;;AAGA,SAASA,iBAAiB,QAAQ,aAAa;AAE/C,cAAc,UAAU;AACxB,SAASA,iBAAiB","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
